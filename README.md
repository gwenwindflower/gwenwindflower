### 👋🌻 hi! my name is gwen windflower but everybody calls me winnie.

💗🤗 it's lovely to meet you!

🤠📊 i'm a data cowgirl.

🍊⚙️ i work in developer experience [@dbt-labs](https://github.com/dbt-labs) these days, but i'm forever an analytics engineer at heart.

📝💻 i'm writing my first novel, and building my first full-stack ML app.

🌱🌤️ i'm super into PKM and note-taking! i currently use a combination of [Neovim with Mkdnflow](https://github.com/jakewvincent/mkdnflow.nvim), [Readwise](https://readwise.io) and [Kinopio](https://kinopio.club) to catalog, visualize, study, and share learning.

#### 📚🤓 currently studying
- TypeScript! learning some computer science basics and building my first full stack app with Next.js to track my reading! More on that soon...
- doing some advanced RAG with LlamaIndex

#### ✨🌸 some things i like that help me code, write, share, and think
- the [Between 3ANC Wireless Earbuds](https://www.status.co/products/between-3anc) - i was a recording engineer and producer in a past life, and these have far better sound quality and noise cancellation than AirPod Pros. big rec.
- the [Planck keyboard](https://blog.zsa.io/2307-goodbye-planck-ez/) - while you can no longer buy the pre-built one made by ZSA, you can still get these from various builders. super cute, portable, and ortholinear, what more can you ask for? i use Kalih BOX White clicky switches.
- the podcast [You Are Good](https://linktr.ee/youaregood) - a 'feelings podcast about movies'. my favorite.
- the [Shure MV7 mic](https://www.shure.com/en-US/products/microphones/mv7) - about 90% as good as the mighty [Shure SM7B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shure_SM7), which is the best microphone normal speech in my opinion, at a much cheaper price point and simpler setup.
