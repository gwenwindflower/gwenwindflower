### üëãüåª hi! my name is gwen windflower but everybody calls me winnie.

üíóü§ó it's really wonderful to meet you!

ü§†üìä i'm what you might call a data cowgirl ‚Äî from analytics to engineering, apps to developer tools, i'm deeply experienced in the craft of extracting maximum utility with the clearest possible systems from even the wildest herds of data. my philosophy centers around _narrative_ ‚Äî i build *story*-first, with the goal of pushing our narratives to hew closer and closer to reality, and with that making them more and more useful. actual change and impact ‚Äî increasing velocity, simplifying, systemizing, creating clarity, and nurturing fingertip-feel for the levers of growth throughout an entire organization ‚Äî these are the metrics i measure my success by. as much as i love spending time on the command line and writing code, the most important work i do is stoking a passion for understanding, encouraging curiousity and exploration, and ensuring everybody can think and speak natively in the language of data. my experience has shown me that 5 people meeting consistently every week to go over the same 30 metrics printed out on PDFs is more powerful than 500 people with the most sophisticated self-service BI system and no consistency. data is like an extra sense, the only one that lets us map the shape of the business, and thoroughly mastering the resources in an area is far more useful than the random glimpses of ad-hoc questions, the answers of which will be forgotten by the end of the day.

üçä‚öôÔ∏è i spent a few years working in developer experience [@dbt-labs](https://github.com/dbt-labs), and before that a couple years in their consulting wing. both were incredible, formative experiences that helped me understand data challenges across a huge variety of organizatioins, sharpen my viewpoint, and become an exceptional teacher. working in DX was particularly special, as our team not only handled typical work like creating resources and community management, but also building tooling and contributing to the product directly, creating a truly comprehensive bridge between dbt Labs and the dbt community. 

üë©üèª‚Äçüåæüìù i am a command line lover and vim obsessive, so i get a bit too into gardening my dotfiles. you can [check them out here](https://github.com/gwenwindflower/.charmschool).

üåçüìö i've been really obsessed with writing cute and useful CLI tools in Go with the [Charm](https://github.com/charmbracelet) libraries lately. it makes me very happy.
