### 💗🌻 hi! my name is gwen windflower but everybody calls me winnie.

💽🌿 i’m a data cowgirl. i ride around my trusty stallion Tab, and make sure all the data is thriving. nurture it, help it grow strong, and when the leaves turn i go shear it and spend the long winter weaving it into tapestries. if you're frustrated that i don't treat data as a plural, sorry, language is living, evolving thing!

🍊⚙️ most recently, i spent a few years working in developer experience at [dbt Labs](https://github.com/dbt-labs), and before that a couple years in their consulting wing. both were incredible, formative experiences that sharpened my approach to data challenges across a huge variety of organizations. they taught me to build excellent things, for sure, but more importantly they showed me that prioritizng people —- becoming an exceptional teacher, building networks of trust, deep listening, nurturing curiosity and ownership in every person, every role -- is orders of magnitude more powerful. working in DX was particularly special, as our team not only handled typical work like creating resources and expanding the community, but also building tools and pushing commits to the product directly when possible. this kind of 'full-stack DX' created a deep, mutally beneficial symbiosis between dbt Labs and the dbt community that helped both thrive.

👩🏻‍🌾🌱 i am a command line lover and vim obsessive, so i get a bit too into gardening my dotfiles. you can [check them out here](https://github.com/gwenwindflower/.charmschool).

🎷🦕 also i've been really obsessed with writing cute and useful CLI tools in Go with the [Charm](https://github.com/charmbracelet) libraries lately. it makes me very happy.
