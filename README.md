💗🤗 it's lovely to meet you!

🤠📊 i'm a data cowgirl, wrangling rows from the prarie of probability to the savannah of statistics.

🍊⚙️ i work in developer experience [@dbt-labs](https://github.com/dbt-labs) these days, but i'm forever an analytics engineer at heart.

📝💻 i'm writing my first novel, and building my first full-stack ML app.

🌱🌤️ i'm super into PKM and note-taking! i currently use a combination of RemNote, Readwise, GitHub Gists, and [Kinopio](https://kinopio.club) to catalog, study, and share learning.

📚🤓 **Currently studying**: TypeScript! Learning some computer science basics and building my first full stack app with Next.js! More on that soon...
