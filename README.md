### 👋🌻 hi! my name is gwen windflower but everybody calls me winnie.

💗🤗 it's lovely to meet you!

🤠📊 i'm a data cowgirl, primarily working in python and SQL, with a focus on wrangling data in cloud warehouses.

🍊⚙️ i work in developer experience [@dbt-labs](https://github.com/dbt-labs) these days, but i'm forever an analytics engineer at heart.

🌱🌤️ i write a blog called [`data cowgirl`](https://datacowgirl.sh)

👩🏻‍🌾📝 i get a bit too into gardening my dotfiles. you can [check them out here](https://github.com/gwenwindflower/charm-school).

#### 📚🤓 currently hacking on
- building a robust [copier template for dbt projects](https://github.com/gwenwindflower/copier-dbt)
- intermittently building my first full stack app with Next.js to track my reading! More on that soon...

#### ✨🌸 some things i like that help me code, write, share, and think
- the [Between 3ANC Wireless Earbuds](https://www.status.co/products/between-3anc) - i was a recording engineer and producer in a past life, and these have far better sound quality and noise cancellation than AirPod Pros. big rec.
- the [Planck keyboard](https://blog.zsa.io/2307-goodbye-planck-ez/) - while you can no longer buy the pre-built one made by ZSA, you can still get these from various builders. super cute, portable, and ortholinear, what more can you ask for? i use Kalih BOX White clicky switches.
- [brain.fm](https://www.brain.fm/) - i find music to be deeply engaging because of my background as a producer, and it's hard for me to work to. conversely, brain.fm's music, which is engineered to provide endless background content and improve focus, works for me though. if you find Spotify a bit too stimulating, you might give it a shot.
- the [Shure MV7 mic](https://www.shure.com/en-US/products/microphones/mv7) - about 78% as good as the venerable [Shure SM7B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shure_SM7) (I've owned both), which is the best microphone for normal speech in my opinion, at a much cheaper price point and simpler setup.
